# Drydeck

## Description

Drydeck is a custom database application built with Django and Python, leveraging the power of PostgreSQL and PostGIS for robust and efficient data management. It utilizes GeoDjango for geographic fields and spatial operations, enhancing the capabilities of traditional databases. The application is served using Daphne, an HTTP and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI, ensuring high performance and concurrency. Nginx, a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, is used for handling static files.
